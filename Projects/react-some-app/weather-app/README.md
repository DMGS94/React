# Hello, welcome to my Weather project!

This is a super cool project where I use React and Tailwind CSS to create a web application that displays the weather. I also use a weather API to fetch real-time weather data. It's a great way to learn about using APIs in React projects!

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A low-level CSS framework that allows for the building of custom designs.
- [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org): I use a weather API to fetch real-time weather data. You should create an account yourself and generate an API for this project to work
