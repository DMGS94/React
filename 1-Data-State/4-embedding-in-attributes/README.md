# Multiple components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Key Points about this project

This project is about React's modularity and reusability. His ability to make data more dynamic by passing it from the parent to the child using props.

In this project, it's rendered one component multiple times, to practice using different props and observing what exactly "reusing" components means.
